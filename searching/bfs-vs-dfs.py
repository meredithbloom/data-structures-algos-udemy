# if you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree
# BFS

# if the tree is very deep and solutions are rare
# BFS - DFS will take a really long time going all the way down, then back up, then down again

# if the tree is very wide (each parent has a ton of child nodes)
# DFS - BFS will need too much memory

# if solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree
# DFS

# determining whether a path exists between two nodes
# DFS

# finding the shortest path
# BFS
